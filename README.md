This repository contains the code written by my team and I in order to build a java based software that would act as a pc app to manage electronic scooter
services. The sofwtare is able to complete many functionalities, as borrowing a scooter, managing the number of rides, the locations of the scooters ... And from the client's side, storing the user's information, the bikes' locations, battery and info ...
